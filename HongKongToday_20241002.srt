00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.950
说话人 1: This SRTHK's Hong Kong Today podcast.

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.230
说话人 2: Bringing you the biggest story from Hong Kong.

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.830
说话人 3: Hi, I'm Samantha Butler. 

4
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:19.960
说话人 3: An estimated 330,000 revellers have turned out to enjoy spectacular fireworks display above Victoria Harbour to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. 

5
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:29.350
说话人 3: The event ran for more than 20 minutes on Tuesday night, although there was disappointment for the second successive night for people hoping to enjoy a drone show. 

6
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.390
说话人 3: Jacqueline Geko reports.

说话人 2: Jack. 

9
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:47.240
说话人 2: There were ooze and us on both sides of Victoria Harbor as people from Hong Kong stood shoulder to shoulder with visitors from the mainland and further, a field to watch the action.

10
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:58.170
说话人 2: The show began at 9:05, five minutes later than planned because an anticipated five minute drone show had to be cancelled literally at the last minute. 

11
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:10.610
说话人 2: In a statement issued at one minute to 9, the government said that ionospheric scintillation over Victoria Harbor meant that the drones could not receive good satellite positioning signals. 

12
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.100
说话人 2: It's the second successive night on which atmospheric interface appearance forced a cancellation of a drone event.

13
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:32.440
说话人 2: However, that didn't dampen the enthusiasm of the huge crowd who enjoyed more than 20 minutes of big bangs and spectacular colors against a stunning backdrop of harbor skyscrapers and mountains. 

14
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.870
说话人 2: Some MTR stations implemented crowd control measures and trains ran late into the night to disperse the crowds. 

15
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:51.050
说话人 2: Revellers hoping to watch the National Day fireworks had been gathering along the Torya harbor to secure a spot hours before the display even began. 

16
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.970
说话人 2: Miss Chen was one of them.

17
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.390
说话人 4: We planned ahead for this and bought different kinds of equipment. 

18
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.710
说话人 4: We started queuing very early, hoping to.

19
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.350
说话人 2: Find the best spot for photos. 

20
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:11.550
说话人 2: Another spectator, Mister Tang, brought his child to see the show and said the combination of fireworks and drones peaked his interest. 

21
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.990
说话人 2: For businesses along the harbor, the fireworks display was a shot in the arm. 

22
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.100
说话人 2: Austin Leo, a general manager of a restaurant near the Chimsha Choi harbourfront, said patrons were more willing to spend. 

23
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.390
说话人 2: He expected business to double during the show.

24
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.870
说话人 5: Tables with better views had been booked up quickly. 

25
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.890
说话人 5: The display certainly has a positive impact. 

26
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.850
说话人 5: Drones and fireworks have boosted our sales.

27
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:55.450
说话人 2: Rocky Yip, director of operations of Harbor Through Spauhnia, said the local firm is carrying a total of 1,100 people in the evening on the three cruises it's operating with 70% of them coming from the mainland.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.340
说话人 3: The SAR government held a flag raising ceremony in Wan Chai on Tuesday morning to celebrate the 75th anniversary.

32
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.150
说话人 2: Please face the national flag and the regional.

33
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.550
说话人 6: Flag. 

34
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.040
说话人 6: They stood solemnly as the national NSR flags were raised. 

35
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.250
说话人 6: The police band played the national anthem, while offices from the fire and government flying services saluted. 

36
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.870
说话人 6: Similar flag raising ceremonies were also held at a Commissioner's office of the Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong, as well as delay Asian Office. 

37
00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:05.970
说话人 6: At the subsequent National Day reception at the convention and Exhibition Center, the CE said Hong Kong will continue to play its unique role in connecting the nation with the rest of the world.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.160
说话人 2: 海国干法金额楼上

39
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.690
说话人 7: In the country's development path, Hong Kong has always been a participant, a contributor and a beneficiary. 

40
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.440
说话人 7: The SAIR's development is linked to that of China, which always gives Hong Kong the strongest backing. 

41
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.440
说话人 7: The Greater Bay Area Outline Development Plan then was announced five years ago. 

42
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.320
说话人 7: Since then, Hong Kong has continued to promote high quality development of the Bay Area, including connecting the region's systems and regulations on a wider and deeper scale. 

43
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.180
说话人 7: We're speeding up the construction of an international level Bay Area.

44
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:49.700
说话人 6: Mister Lee added that Hong Kong is undergoing a key economic trend transition, which he said presents more opportunities than challenges. 

45
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.620
说话人 6: He said people must adjust to change and promote reforms to contribute to the country's developments.

46
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:03.100
说话人 3: Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Tiananmen Square in Beijing for its National Day flag raising ceremony. 

47
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.460
说话人 3: As Azam Khan reports, millions of people also kicked off their Golden Week holidays.

48
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:22.240
说话人 1: Spectators gathered to witness a ceremony at Tiananmen Square where the national anthem was played as the national flag was raised and pigeons were released. 

49
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:33.250
说话人 1: The day also kicked off a seven day Golden Week holiday with the nation's rail operator saying they're expecting to handle 175 million passenger trips for the period. 

50
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:49.910
说话人 1: China's state railway group added that in response to the surge in passenger demand, measures will be taken to boost transportation capacity, enhance services and ensure safe, orderly and enjoyable trips. 

51
00:05:50.150 --> 00:06:02.320
说话人 1: Meanwhile, officials said that Beijing Dashing International Airport is expected to handle more than 6,400 flights and more than 1.03 million passengers during the holiday period. 

52
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:12.590
说话人 1: Chengdu, Shanghai and Guangzhou were the top domestic destinations for passengers from Beijing, while popular international spots included Tokyo and Singapore.

53
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:26.420
说话人 3: Discounts and special offers were rolled out to celebrate National Day with movie theaters across Hong Kong offering half price tickets and some 3,600 restaurants, stores, supermarkets and hotels offering discounts. 

54
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.170
说话人 3: Haley, it went out to hunt for bargains.

55
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.530
说话人 4: Mister Sham was queuing outside the cinema in festival Wakmala National Day. 

56
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:43.770
说话人 4: He said his family took advantage of the half priced movie tickets and calls it a great way to get Hong Kongers and tourists out in a bet on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

57
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.530
说话人 2: I.

58
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:52.460
说话人 6: Think it's great because it gets more people to spend in Hong Kong, whether it's at restaurants, cinemas or other fun places. 

59
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.750
说话人 6: It should stimulate Hong Kong's economy and it gives families more places to go to.

60
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:04.760
说话人 4: German tourist Michelle said she enjoyed the lively atmosphere and that the discounts came as a pleasant surprise.

61
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.680
说话人 8: Actually, I haven't really heard about the discounts. 

62
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.760
说话人 8: I don't even know what all it. 

63
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.580
说话人 8: I mean, all the prices regular. 

64
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.990
说话人 8: So it's probably a good thing. 

65
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:23.150
说话人 8: Yeah, and it's nice to have it, but that's not the reason for us to come and not the reason for us to go out. 

66
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.340
说话人 8: We would do it.

67
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.860
说话人 4: Anyway. 

68
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.660
说话人 4: And a local woman queuing outside one of the restaurants offering discounts said the deals were good for the community.

69
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.220
说话人 9: A 25% discount is a good thing. 

70
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.340
说话人 9: It benefits everyone and it revitalizes the economy. 

71
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.690
说话人 9: If there weren't any discounts, people would stay at home, they wouldn't go out and businesses would suffer. 

72
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.450
说话人 9: I'll order a more expensive breakfast. 

73
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:46.730
说话人 9: I definitely will.

74
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:55.060
说话人 4: People were also able to ride the tram and take many ferry routes for free on National Day, including the Star Ferry. 

75
00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:01.660
说话人 4: The MTR gave passengers a 25% discount on most lines as well as the light rail and its bus services. 

76
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:10.080
说话人 4: A local man surnamed Skiller, who attended a flygrasing ceremony at City University, said the discounts and special offers definitely boosted morale. 

77
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:10.640
说话人 4: Think it's a.

78
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.200
说话人 10: Good idea? 

79
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.280
说话人 10: Yeah, I like the idea. 

80
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.840
说话人 10: I was actually wondering why the MTR was so cheap though. 

81
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.200
说话人 10: That's because of the discount. 

82
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.130
说话人 10: We're thinking about going to Llama Island and going to a restaurant there. 

83
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.410
说话人 10: And yeah, let's see what we can.

84
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:24.690
说话人 4: Get. 

85
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:29.530
说话人 4: KMB, LWB and City Bus were also offering free rides for children. 

86
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:38.690
说话人 4: Separately, people were able to use venues managed by the leisure and Cultural Services department for free for 30 minutes, though they needed to book through a balloting system.

87
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:49.050
说话人 3: Police Chief Raymond Sue says there were around 7,000 officers deployed to various districts for National Day as mainland travelers descend on Hong Kong for their Golden Week holiday. 

88
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.850
说话人 3: Damon Peng reports.

89
00:08:53.870 --> 00:09:03.670
说话人 6: Speaking after attending a reception at the convention and Exhibition Center in Manchai, Mister Sue said he hopes the public can feel happiness on such an important day. 

90
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:21.670
说话人 6: Meanwhile, the director of immigration, Benson Cock, said Hong Kong is expecting a high number of mainland travelers on National Day and that the border points connected to the Israel line are expected to be the busiest ones, while many travelers are also expected to take the express rail to West Gallon Station.

91
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.380
说话人 11: Immigration department is ready. 

92
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.340
说话人 11: We've basically deployed all available border staff at the checkpoints as far as possible. 

93
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:39.060
说话人 11: We hope everything will go smoothly and that travelers coming south from the mainland can cross the border in a speedy and convenient manner.

94
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:45.380
说话人 6: At West Gallon Station, a tourist from Shanghai said prices for flight tickets to Hong Kong were expensive. 

95
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.680
说话人 6: So they flew to Shenzhen and then took the express trial to the SAR.

96
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.010
说话人 12: We came to Hong Kong because the children want to visit. 

97
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.170
说话人 12: We'll go to the Ocean Park and walk around the urban areas. 

98
00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.970
说话人 12: We also want to see the National Day fireworks. 

99
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.770
说话人 12: We don't have fireworks in Shanghai, so we came to Hong Kong. 

100
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.860
说话人 12: The children want to see the fireworks.

101
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:14.040
说话人 6: And another tourist from Shenzhen said he embarked on a day trip to watch the fireworks and the drone show.

102
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.560
说话人 3: The government should be more aggressive when it comes to attracting big names and hosting world class events here. 

103
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:27.040
说话人 3: That's according to the Our Hong Kong Foundation, which proposed the setting up of a mega events office for higher level coordination. 

104
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:32.380
说话人 3: The think tank also called for greater cooperation with other greater Bay Area cities. 

105
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:38.050
说话人 3: An assistant researcher of the Our Hong Kong Foundation, Jocelyn , spoke to Janice Low.

106
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:49.550
说话人 2: So if we look at Singapore, they have Sport Singapore and Sport Tourism Board and their government officials really play an active role in bidding for top events in the world. 

107
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:54.800
说话人 2: And in Qatar, they set up bidding committees just for the World Cup, for example. 

108
00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:06.000
说话人 2: Whereas in Hong Kong and the government only provides a letter of support and also the Mr funding, which is subject to a ceiling of 15 million for the matching grant. 

109
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.240
说话人 2: And we do think that in terms of funding support could be more flexible. 

110
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:18.280
说话人 2: And apart from that, there are also a lot of issues with organization and coordination that could be improved. 

111
00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:27.500
说话人 2: And that's why in this report, we recommend the government establish a mega events office to coordinate from a higher level. 

112
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:34.150
说话人 2: How effective do you think a mega event's office will be in Shenping, Hong Kong, into a mega sports events capital? 

113
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:44.100
说话人 2: We think that the Mega Events Office will show that the government is really committed to building Hong Kong into a mega sports events capital.

114
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:58.580
说话人 2: Right now, we also have the coordination group, and we think that the government could still step up its efforts in doing so if Hong Kong wants to hold maybe even a bigger scale event that might exceed the capacity of Kai Tech Sports Park. 

115
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.780
说话人 2: Is there any way that Hong Kong can improve itself? 

116
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.500
说话人 2: Or what's more, can Hong Kong do? 

117
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:15.310
说话人 2: Hong Kong could collaborate with GBA cities more to co host multi sports events because obviously hosting a multi sport event would lead to a huge financial burden to the city. 

118
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.150
说话人 2: And we see that co hosting is really a global trend. 

119
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:29.210
说话人 2: So we think that co hosting with GBA would not only reduce the financial burden, but would also promote sports tourism around the area. 

120
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:38.810
说话人 2: And this is great for Hong Kong as well as the entire GBA's economic development application procedures for using the high tech sports park.

121
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:45.370
说话人 2: What are the problems that the foundation has noticed and what are the suggestions that you think the government can do better? 

122
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.850
说话人 2: We have spoken to over 50 stakeholders. 

123
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:53.290
说话人 2: A lot of them worry that applying for these licenses would take a long time. 

124
00:12:53.290 --> 00:13:03.360
说话人 2: And oftentimes international organizers, they don't have experience organizing events locally, so they wouldn't know which government departments they have to be in touch with. 

125
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.300
说话人 2: And this could cause great problems and lead to chaotic arrangements. 

126
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:20.170
说话人 2: So we recommend that the government has a mega events office that could streamline these different procedures and also offer one stop service for both international and local event organizers.

127
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:28.340
说话人 2: Oftentimes, the licensing procedure takes more than 42 days, 40 days, two days was only according to the official document. 

128
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:42.530
说话人 2: So we think that actually for Kaita Sports Park, as it has gained more successful event experiences, it could transform into licensing model similar to lcsds venues. 

129
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:49.990
说话人 2: So this means that they could have private sector to do the checking and have certifications approved by the government. 

130
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:58.810
说话人 2: And this would reduce the time needed to contact different government departments, which would increase the licensing processing time.

说话人 4: I.

139
00:14:47.370 --> 00:15:06.860
说话人 13: Guess that comes down to the fans ultimately, because hopefully the fans will wanna be at this first event as part of the legacy, obviously be some features of transferring some elements of the South stand into the new stadium and then again, some state to the art pieces in the stadium that are gonna be new to the fans, but equally and exciting new. 

140

说话人 13: There is a retractable roof. 

146
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:25.500

147
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.460
说话人 13: But also, you know, the view of the pitch, it's gonna be different to the old stadium. 

148
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:35.340
说话人 13: But you, you know, very exciting for viewers to see that pitch within the whole new state of the art stadium.

149
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.820
说话人 4: And the new venue has a bigger capacity than the Hong Kong Stadium. 

150
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.190
说话人 4: How will that affect your ticket sales strategy?

151
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:56.190
说话人 13: We hope that we're gonna entice regular and invaluable fans, and then we may be able to obviously entice a new crowd of supporters from, you know, maybe increase our international visitors as well as more local support from different parts of the communities in Hong Kong. 

152
00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.150
说话人 13: I'm gonna entice them to come to the new stadium.

153
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:03.510

154
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.240
说话人 4: So what's your vision for your first Hong Kong Sevens as CEO?

155
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:16.620
说话人 13: First, hopefully make it a sellout, but that's probably an obvious thing to say, but I want fans to walk away at the end of the weekend and say it was the most fantastic experience. 

156
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:22.410
说话人 13: Whilst they valued previous, you know, the stadium before, but they were inspired by new experience and new environment. 

157
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:32.820
说话人 13: And then for us to inspire the next generation of children and youth, young people in Hong Kong by attending such an amazing event will be pleasing for me as CEO. 

158
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:33.260
说话人 13: So.

159
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.700
说话人 4: The Hong Kong China team competed in a different format earlier this year. 

160
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.930
说话人 4: Will it be the same again in 2025? 

161
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.450
说话人 4: Or will they be competing in the main event?

162
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:49.500
说话人 13: Yeah, so they'll likely continue in the Claymores competition again, which again gives, I guess, because of the nature of the World Series, our teams are just outside the World Series. 

163
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:57.340
说话人 13: They get chance to play in that Claymore's tournament, which again, hopefully as a crowd pleaser and a crowd pullers chance to see our local players do a fantastic job on the field. 

164
00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.660
说话人 13: So that format will remain. 

165
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.230

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.520
说话人 13: So all of the top teams from the World Series.
